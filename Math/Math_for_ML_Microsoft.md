## Mathematics for Machine Learning - Microsoft Technical Course ##
  
  
I had been going around, taking quite a few courses in Machine Learning, Python and Data Science.  
All of them had a lot of mathematical concepts being thrown around now and then. While my background in Mechanical Engg and Maths helped me pick all that up pretty well, I still felt, an end-to-end course with Microsoft might just help me tie up some loose end and ofc, boost my employability. :p
