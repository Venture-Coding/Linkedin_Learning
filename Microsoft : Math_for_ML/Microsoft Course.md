## Mathematics for Machine Learning - Microsoft Technical Course ##
  
  
I had been going around, taking quite a few courses in Machine Learning, Python and Data Science.  
All of them had a lot of mathematical concepts being thrown around now and then. While my background in Mechanical Engg and Maths helped me pick all that up pretty well, I still felt, an end-to-end course with Microsoft might just help me tie up some loose end and ofc, boost my employability. :p 

  
Notes to self:  
Revise Module 3 EVal, EVecs, Rank-deficiency, Decomposition every 6 mon ;}  
Use ci = stats.norm.interval(0.95, m, sd) for Conf Int.  
Z-score uses Pop Std (1.96 for 95%, 2.575 for 99%), t- will use Sample std.
