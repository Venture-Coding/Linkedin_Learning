## Web Scraping ##

The basic essence of data science and machine learning is data. No algorithm can ever perform good enough, unless it has the data to train on and test on.  
It is precisely for this reason that the data mining techniques acquire great importance. And being a good machine learning engineer, one has to be equally adept at not only analyzing data, but getting one's own data whenever required.  
  
In this pursuit of data collection we come across APIs, Databases, Data.gov, Kaggle datasets and many more...  
But, none of these can ever replace the one, the only, the most original form of data collection - Scraping.  
Scraping can be done via multiple methods, multiple means. It can either be headless or not, paginated or not, tabulated, streaming.... or any of the endless things that it could be, given the fact that it is Data, afteral.  
  
In these projects I've worked on acquiring the core skillsets required for web-scraping and tried these out on website.  
One such project done to scrape my favorite book's review data, has also been included herein.
