I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Links identity and habits. You are what you do. From that point of view, just going to the gym makes you the type of person who works out, even if you don't do much of a workout.<br/>- Introduces the idea that habits bring cumulative benefits like compound interest. While not obviously always the case, it's a powerful idea that definitely applies in areas like meditation or physical training, where the observable changes are minimal at first.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The book doesn't delve into examples of good habits and the why and how to build them. It stays at the meta / generic level, leaving the reader to think about what habits they may want to build.<br/>- The overall principles for building good habits are sound, even if high level and a bit obvious (make the good habits easy, the bad ones hard, etc).<br/>- The book is way too long for what it has to convey. Often things repeat or you wonder when the next chapter or thought will start, and when that happens, you lose track of what the earlier one was about -- mainly due to their length.<br/><br/>Overall, not recommended.\n",

Since that time his exploration of habits and how to modify them has easily equaled or surpassed the work of Charles Duhigg.<br/>I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve and build good habits or stifle and destroy bad ones.  As I have the audio version,  one of the reasons I give the book 4/5 is due to the speed at which he speaks, which is not bad and I admit to being spoilt by the professional narrators of two other audiobooks in, Deep Work and Rejectionproof. The other reason is the reliance on the work of social scientists, psychologists, etc.  I realize that a number of books in the self-improvement space use scientific studies from the above-mentioned fields but the scandals concerning p-hacking and failure to replicate experiments make me wonder how valid the examples in this book and books like it really are.<br/>Having said all of that, I would not have stuck with James all these years if he did not provide information that was useful and more importantly, actionable. I look forward to reading whatever he writes next.\n",

            "  8/10<br/><br/>Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life.<br/>I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material.<br/>I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.<br/>This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an air-tight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit.<br/>I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter.<br/>The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good.\n",

He mixes the perfect blend of science and stories to get the point across and make you feel like creating new habits is not some daunting task only for special people but for anyone. I found myself nodding along as I listened and stopped it at least a dozen times to take notes.<br/><br/>I got at least 4-5 'a-ha' moments about building habits that shattered the conventional wisdom I'd always thought about before. From realizing that I've been approaching will-power the wrong way and the question that I should ask myself next time I want to lose weight or work out.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about Atomic Habits since I finished it and cannot wait to dig into it again. I've been recommending it to everyone.\n",

I've read a lot on the topic of habits, including Charles Duhigg's book. I think Atomic Habits delivers the best science and easiest practical applications for habit change that is available today.<br/><br/>This book has not only been blowing my mind, but I've been taking diligent notes on the strategies and tactics to put to use immediately. The Habit Scorecard is a great example of a self inventory on good, neutral, and bad habits - which starts with awareness about your habits.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 is a total game-changer and something I've actually believed for a long time, to change your habits, you have to change your beliefs about who you want to become. You have to aspire to become what you are seeking to change. In other words, it's not about the outcome, it's about what you value and who you're striving to be. This is transformative stuff and so glad James has written about this.<br/><br/>Honestly, there is not one person I know who wouldn't benefit from reading this book as habits are truly the core of success in any area of life.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend reading and applying this book because it speaks the truth: small changes repeated over and over make the biggest difference in the quality of our lives. These strategies can be applied to anything.<br/><br/>HUGE congrats to James Clear for sharing such brilliant work!\n",

            "  8/10Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life.I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material.I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an air-tight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit.I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter.The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good.\n",

            "['\\n\\n  It’s the not the content of the book but the book itself..it was poorly put together including the book cover. I actually shut the book and haven’t picked back it up again for the misspelled word in the title..Attrective..really😳\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This book was way overhyped.  I found it to be simplistic and dull.Worse, after completing it, I listed it on a well-known website for trade in used products, and the author reported me to the site as selling a \"counterfeit\" product, and my account was suspended for four days.  I sent him an email but he did not respond.  So do not buy the book if you intend to resell it when you are done.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  All of the material covered could have been condensed in 1 chapter. if you\\'ve read other books like \"The Slight Edge\" and \"The Compound Effect\", this book won\\'t add much value.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I barely made it through 1/3 of the book. Reading it as an audiobook, I found it very repetitive and monotonous. As I read, and as the author spoke of methods and mental operations, my mind was drawn to two books that I read decades ago:\\xa0\\n\\nPsycho-Cybernetics\\n\\n  \\xa0and\\xa0\\n\\nAddiction and Grace\\n\\n  , both written by medical doctors, both which explain things like habits and their formation in a way that has stayed with me all these years. In contrast, I remember little of what I read in this book, maybe because it was so annoying and kept making me think of what I learned long ago.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  He says what should be obvious. This book insults my intelligence.  That's hard to do.  Probably worth reading If you are younger than 25.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  On of the best motivational books I ever read. I have not finished it yet but James Clear’s ideas and direction about how to charge yourself into better and more organized person is so clear and rational. It’s very easy to read. Very interesting facts about how our habits develop and work and how to change them. If you do want to change your bad habits and improve your good habits you need to work on yourself. I do recommend to buy Clear Habit Journal, it will really help you along the way.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  As many other readers have pointed out, the utterly superficial and completely obvious points made in this book could have been encompassed in an article or a pamphlet. I am absolutely baffled that this book is currently a bestseller with so many 5-star reviews. Are we just becoming dumber as a society? This book pulls points shamelessly from various well-known research and works by other authors, and Clear seems to think that mentioning and praising their work with an air of humility and admiration somehow justifies the fact that he is recycling, and not presenting anything new here. Then there are the quotes sourced from places like Reddit and Twitter (which will only be recognized by those of us who are more detail-oriented and who dig a little deeper)... which just makes it seem like we could all just go directly to Twitter or Reddit for our own inspiration.  I wanted to abandon this book before I was even a fourth of the way through it, but I stubbornly hung in there, wanting to remain open-minded and to give it a chance. Then sentences like \"Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm,\" and \"Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly\" began to jump out at me more and more. And don\\'t even let me get started on the charts and \"graphs\" that the author uses to support his painfully obvious points -- they are so insulting to the intelligence of any functioning adult of reasonable intellect that I found myself wanting to chuck this book with each subsequent \"illustration\" I encountered. (X and Y axis values, anyone?) If you are contemplating purchasing this book, and you are a reasonably intelligent adult -- don\\'t. Don\\'t waste your money, and more importantly, your precious time. Any grains of wisdom in this book, you can easily pick up from browsing through the preview. There is no additional wisdom, or useful strategies, to be found -- unless, perhaps, you have literally never read one single thing about the neuroscience behind habit formation. One decent Google search on strategies to form good habits and to break bad ones will readily get you more useful ideas than this entire 300 page book with its numerous references and links to Clear\\'s website. Based on so many good reviews, and on browsing through the book preview, I had rather optimistic hopes for Atomic Habits. I was incredibly disappointed.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Points are obvious. I thought that this was going to be more about the neuroscience behind habits, but it’s just another self-help book.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Right at the start of the book, the author goes on and on and on about how some British cycling team used their own version of Atomic Habits to make incremental improvements until they could win a major internaitonal race.  I pulled out my phone and checked, and sure enough that team actually just started using illegal performance-enhancing drugs.  In all fairness, though, I guess that every other team cheats too, so that was probably the only way for them to actually stand a chance, and they may well have benefited from atomic habits on the road to victory.I wish they'd gone and published a revised version without the blatant BS right at the start, because that pretty much ruined the book for me.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Decent but seriously overhyped, this book is a watered-down, distorted shadow of Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg.  If this book is from the Stone Age, then Tiny Habits is from the Space Age.  There are critically important, yet subtle points about the behavior change process that Clear misses in Atomic Habits but that Fogg emphasizes in Tiny Habits.  There\\'s coarse advice in Atomic Habits--such as habit contracts and accountability partners--that are probably more harmful than helpful in many situations.  Remember Fogg\\'s sage advice: \"I change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.\"  Tiny Habits is far more elegant, more concise, and presents a self-contained system that\\'s effective and universal and also explains anything in Clear\\'s book more neatly than Clear presents it himself.  If you have to choose between this book and Tiny Habits, I strongly recommend reading and using Tiny Habits instead.  Even if you\\'ve read this book, you should read Tiny Habits to pick up what you\\'ve missed out on here and to really calibrate your behavior-change system.  Atomic Habits smacks of being written by a motivational writer with a strong interest in habits who decided to cash in on his large email list with a book deal, while Tiny Habits is written by an actual behavior researcher and educator with a system proven to work on any level and who actually trained tens of thousands of people in his technique before deciding to write a book.  The only way in which Atomic Habits is superior to Tiny Habits is in its discussion of meta-habits (see the section on annual and semiannual reviews).  But even that stuff is freely available online in podcasts and blogs.  I couldn\\'t pick out a single original idea in this book.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I didn’t like this book at all. I had high expectations based on the reviews but it was a total waste of money. There’s nothing on the book that I don’t already know. It doesn’t have a guideline, instead  it uses dumb examples of people who accomplished certain goals based on their habits. I stopped reading it 3/4 of the way through.

The book is chock full of real, practical, and actional advice anyone can take to add more good habits and tweak bad habits over the long term.I was able to listen to a copy and James is a clear narrator who tells an interesting story. He mixes the perfect blend of science and stories to get the point across and make you feel like creating new habits is not some daunting task only for special people but for anyone. I found myself nodding along as I listened and stopped it at least a dozen times to take notes.I got at least 4-5 'a-ha' moments about building habits that shattered the conventional wisdom I'd always thought about before. From realizing that I've been approaching will-power the wrong way and the question that I should ask myself next time I want to lose weight or work out.I've been thinking about Atomic Habits since I finished it and cannot wait to dig into it again. I've been recommending it to everyone.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've been a fan of James Clear for some time and I think his work is amazing. I couldn't be more happy to see his new book come out and I've been devouring this since I got it. I've read a lot on the topic of habits, including Charles Duhigg's book. I think Atomic Habits delivers the best science and easiest practical applications for habit change that is available today.This book has not only been blowing my mind, but I've been taking diligent notes on the strategies and tactics to put to use immediately. The Habit Scorecard is a great example of a self inventory on good, neutral, and bad habits - which starts with awareness about your habits.Chapter 2 is a total game-changer and something I've actually believed for a long time, to change your habits, you have to change your beliefs about who you want to become. You have to aspire to become what you are seeking to change. In other words, it's not about the outcome, it's about what you value and who you're striving to be. This is transformative stuff and so glad James has written about this.Honestly, there is not one person I know who wouldn't benefit from reading this book as habits are truly the core of success in any area of life.I HIGHLY recommend reading and applying this book because it speaks the truth: small changes repeated over and over make the biggest difference in the quality of our lives. These strategies can be applied to anything.HUGE congrats to James Clear for sharing such brilliant work!\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I found this book to be a solid follow-up to Charles Duhigg's Power of Habit, which James Clear references in this work. Clear builds upon Duhigg's explanation of habits and explains ways to make it easier for people to both create good habits and break bad habits. His thesis is focused on the 4 laws that make good habits (make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying) and the 4 laws that can break bad habits (make it invisible, make it unattractive, make it difficult, make it unsatisfying). His writing is clear and understandable. I like how there's a concise summary at the end of each chapter and how Clear offers actionable advice. I do feel like some of the later chapters were just filler chapters and that the book could be leaner, but I can understand their placement in the book. Nothing in the book is truly revolutionary but it makes for a quick and actionable read.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This is one of those self-help books that seems to offer a way to get one's life on track. I have read chapter one and found it to be highly motivating and useful.EXCEPT. Except, chapter one describes the techniques used by a bicycle racing team that showed incredible improvement because of them. An asterisk on page 15 leads to a footnote which refers to a web site where the author says the racing team might also have been using performance enhancing drugs. Wow. How can I continue through the book if the connections made between “atomic habits” and actual results was so poorly analyzed?If they had time to put in a footnote, they had time to stop publication and rework the book. Instead they squandered their credibility. All that said, it is so well written, and so motivating, that I might be able to pick it up again and make use of the concepts. We will see. If I change my opinion, I will come back and edit this.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I really think a lot of people had their first experience with self help with this book. This was very overhyped and people really ate it up. It\\'s just an average self-help book though. 90% fluff and 10% known, sort of fruitful, information. The only two bits of helpful information from this book was the \"systems\" thing, foolish name btw which I\\'ll explain in second, and environment. The systems thing is just subgoals. You have some grand goal like, \"I want to take better care of my teeth\" and so you set up subgoals/systems like \"alright I\\'ll floss, brush, use mouth wash every day in the morning.\" The environment thing is your work space. You don\\'t want to work at the same PC that you can\\'t stop playing League of Legends once you start playing. You want to have a dedicated study/work/reading area. So yeah there\\'s the book. Don\\'t buy.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  For centuries people have understood the power of habits.  Around 2,000 years ago, the Roman poet Ovid wrote, “Nothing is stronger than habit.”  The 18th century English writer Samuel Johnson wrote, “The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.”For some time now, we’ve even known how to break habits.  Erasmus, a 16th century Dutch philosopher, wrote, “A nail is driven out by another nail. Habit is overcome by habit.”Stanford Professor B.J. Fogg has made quite a name for himself with his research and teaching of Tiny Habits.If you have done any reading/studying around habits and changing human behavior, you might wonder if there is anything new or exciting in Atomic Habits written by James Clear.The short answer is yes.  This is a well written, well thought out approach to changing habits.Mr. Clear starts by showing why changing behavior is so difficult.  Most people approach behavior change from a wanting something different standpoint.  A few improve their odds by approaching behavior change from a process standpoint.  As Mr. Clear points out, unless you approach behavior change from aligning your long-term behavior with your core beliefs, you have little chance of succeeding.  Instead of focusing on the have or doing, you must first focus on who you wish to be.  There is a short hand for this – Be – Do and then Have.Mr. Clear then guides the reader on a four-step process showing how any behavior is created and developed into a habit. He calls this Cue – Craving – Response (action) – Reward.To create a new habit, you need to 1) Make if obvious 2) Make it attractive 3) Make it easy and 4) Make it satisfying.  To break a habit, simply do the reverse 1) Make it invisible, 2) Make it unattractive 3) Make it difficult and 4) Make it unsatisfying.The book is thoroughly engaging.  Mr. Clear is an accomplished writer.  His writing style is very conversational.  He illustrates the concepts with engaging, real stories.You will be a slave to your habits.  You also have the power to choose the ones you want in your life – they can serve you or rule you.  This book gives you all the tools and information you need to dramatically change your life by changing your habits.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I have slogged through most of this book, and am disappointed.  The book starts off with a lengthy expose about the British cycling team's rise to pinnacle of the sport by developing good habits and building on incremental improvements.  The entire story is demolished by a footnote added late in publishing: British Cycling won by using performance-enhancing drugs.That's a terrible way to start a book about habits, don't you think?It doesn't get better.  Each chapter is sprinkled by callouts and anecdotes.  Some of these might have been interesting, even revealing had more details been provided.  The unfortunate effect is much like hawker in an open bazaar.  There are tantalizing references to the underlying psychology of habit formation, but very little depth.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  A long time fan of James Clear's supremely researched articles and helpful newsletter, I've been eagerly awaiting this book. It does not disappoint. Clear's thoughtful approach to a topic that could easily be considered boring, is a delight to read. Not only is the advice in the book practical, Clear explains the science and evidence behind the ideas. When reading a book like this, the real test for me is how often I think about it after I've finished the read; that's when I know it's made an impact on my thinking or behavior. I find myself thinking back on Atomic Habits daily; making connections to the material in my own life and work, and making changes accordingly. Must-read.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  \"Self help\" is in quotes because I think this book is unfairly lumped into that category. This isn\\'t some feel-good book that gets you excited for a day or two before going right back to who you were before reading it. Not only is this scientifically backed and driven at every step, but its steps are also simplified down to a single page that you can reference as much as you need (it\\'s so easy though that you won\\'t need to).It\\'s all about starting small and big things will happen down the line - and how to start on the smallest level possible.A few weeks later and I can already point to multiple small things that I\\'ve changed in my life that are paying large dividends.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has been putting off learning a new skill or trying to get rid of a bad habit. You\\'ll be upset how easy it actually was all long but glad you finally did it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I\\'ve been a fan of James Clear since I came across the YouTube video in November 2017, \"1% Better Every Day\" (I actually have a recurring reminder set up in my task manager every 6 months to rewatch this video since then---absolutely not kidding!).When I heard on The Productivity Show Podcast that James Clear is coming out with this book on 10/16 I purchased it right on the day it got released. I\\'ve read over 40 books this year and I\\'d consider this book to be one of my personal top 3 most impactful book of 2018.I admit that I am a recovering perfectionist and put a lot of pressure on myself to excel at goals I\\'ve set out for myself. After reading this book, instead of focusing on goals I\\'ve listed out processes and micro habits it will take to \"become\" the person I want to identify with. I can already feel a huge amount of pressure taken off. Side note: I also love how each chapters start out with a short story relevant to the chapter topic. I look forward to re-reading this book again and reviewing all of my highlighted sections.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Nothing to write home about. You can learn much more from just reading the Bible and practicing what it says.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  So I read the book... and to be honest, I felt like this was information that is practically common sense.  Maybe it’s just me, but after seeing so many positive reviews for this book I was hoping for life altering advice that no other book has divulged.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wow, What a great book!First I love that the author read the audio version help self. I always think you get more hearing it straight from the author and he has a great voice for it.Second, I really appreciate how practical the whole this is. It’s the perfect mix of how-to advice with scientific research and memorable stories.I’m already seeing results from his “Four simple steps to building better habits.” I can see why some habits I’ve tried to create in the past have failed and why some have succeeded. I also really like the bonus downloads he talks about in the book. The Cheat Sheet has been especially helpful.Third, I love that it’s appropriate and engaging for all ages. I’ve listened to a lot of it with my 11 year old and he’s already experimenting with creating new habits to help him focus on his homework. Of course, it’s because he wants to finish early and move on to video games! But I see how appealing of a reward that is for him, so it’s not all bad.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Atomic Habits is a beautiful, fancy, and well marketed book. But it\\'s the wrong book if you\\'re serious about self-improvement. It\\'s surface level over a single method of habit formation and is just flat wrong about some of the principles he claims are key to habit formation. For example, using your identity as the base to build your habits on is dangerous. To understand why, I\\'d suggest the \"Awareness\" book below. Therefore, if you really want to change read these books instead: - The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal - Awareness by Anthony de Mell\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Everyone has habits that need changing - things you need to stop doing (smoking, procrastinating) and things you need to start doing more of (exercising, writing). This is a useful guide to the tricks you can use to help you develop good habits and rid yourself of bad ones. For example: Habit needs to become part of your identity (not \"I have to go the the gym\", but \"I am a healthy person\"). Make good habits easy to do and bad ones inconvenient (put fruit on your kitchen counter, but hide the cookies). Four points are key: Cue-craving-response-reward.All useful stuff - and worth reminding yourself of now and again. But there is nothing terribly new in this book. I preferred Charles Duhigg\\'s earlier \"The Power of Habit\". This book is worth a quick read, and some of the examples are fun. Certainly, if you follow some of the hints, you will acquire better habits. But not worth five stars.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Very disappointing. I expected it to be a summary of the book by the same name. It is not. Worse, it is very poorly edited with numerous typographical error’s and whole paragraphs that repeat themselves at random. For an example see the citation to the quote on page 104. The author is listed as “Juan F. Kennedy. “ save your money for something else.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This was a technical look at why we do what we do. I was hoping to find a more emotionally combined mix of motivation and information. Good book, but I am surprised by the number of people rating this with five stars. Maybe they are in the habit of rating everything that they like, with five stars. Glad that I read this book, but as far as motivating me to the next level to make those changes it missed.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I wasn’t a fan of the book. I couldn’t finish it. I was expecting a self-help book about better ones habits and creating a better lifestyle. The book I got was a self center guy who begins about talking how his high school self wouldn’t socialize, but instead focused on creating a better sleep schedule and staying in, and how he has spent his entire life being the most organized person ever. It also was heavily center on weight and he mentions going to the gym all the time, like that is the only habit that matters in a persons life. He just seemed very fake, self centered, and only focused on surface level issues, like weight and looks. Not really the self betterment I was looking for.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have subscribed to the author\\'s email newsletters for years as I find them both motivating and helpful. His book is similar but is not a rehashed compilation of his emails-- he has actually done a decent amount of research. His biography is also very revealing, having overcome physical hurdles to achieve athletic goals as well as adopting a mindset in college that was different from his peers and allowed him to succeed in the classroom. Clear definitely has some mix of nature and nurture that makes him both intellectually curious and tenacious.To achieve a goal, focus on the habit(s) that help you achieve that goal instead of being fixated on the goal itself. Make performing those habits as easy and natural as possible.\"Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?\"\"Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.This is the secret to self-control.\"One challenge I took away from this book is to get into the practice of \"habit stacking,\" setting habits to be performed one after the other:\"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].The habit stacking formula is: \\'After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\\'\"For example, I have a vague goal of doing more pull-ups. I hung a chin-up bar on a door that I walk past frequently. I have a rule: Every time I walk by the door I do one more pull-up than I did before. A good habit-stacking routine might be to think about one thing I\\'m thankful for after every pull-up routine. Or to also do one more push-up than I did before. Or, since I have a stack of thank you notes I need to write, I write a thank-you note after every pull-up set.\"Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.\"\"Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.\"Once I start doing pull-ups, I become a guy who exercises-- who does pull-ups. Pull-ups are a challenge for many people, so I can start to develop an identity that I do challenging things.The author also talks about the importance of making such habits pleasurable. Maybe I have a reward that if I do 15 pull-ups in a day, I\\'ll let myself check Facebook. Seeing \"likes\" on Facebook posts gives me a rush of dopamine. The dopamine becomes the reward from my having done 15 pull-ups.\"It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds.\"This book helps you get where you want to be by helping you establish routines where you are today. Focus on the habit and eventually you\\'ll find you\\'ve arrived at your goal.4.5 stars out of 5. As a caveat, I find these types of habit books more readily embraced by men than women. My observation is that men have an easier time being rote in their habits; eating the same meals every day (requiring the same preparation, same shopping list, same routine every time). This book had a rather un-emotional feel to it like many other books by men talking about habits and optimization (ie: Tim Ferriss).\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I don't know if it's my common sense or my psych degree, but most of his points seemed beyond obvious. I don't mean to sound pretentious but I got absolutely nothing out of this book.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Nothing against Charles Duhigg, his book was also very good, but James really brought it home on how to change my horrible habits! It’s a fantastic read, and it is saving me from my emotional eating issues one small teeny tiny habit at a time. Baby steps! His interviews are great too, check him out on YouTube. Great book! Well worth the money, seriously. Quit messing around telling yourself that you will change your habits tomorrow, and get it going TODAY.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  The title and reviews led me to purchase this book. The first few pages were riveting. I'm so glad the author  was able to recuperate from his life threatening situation, but the rest of the pages were less impactful. He repeats the same theme, to find good habits and repeat them. Good habits are common sense. Tried to find more inspiration in the book, it just wasn't there for ME.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I appreciate the fact that he wanted to convey that his technique is backed  by so much research that is proven to be effective. However, it is so hard to read through so much theory just to get to the technique of creating good habits. Those tips were buried in with the long drawn out explanations, and were hard to pull out from the text. I had to take notes constantly. In the end, I got a couple of good tips to help me but again it was so hard to read and decipher just the meat of what he was trying to advise his readers to do.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  While the author presents several worthwhile negotiation strategies and tactics, the overwhelming majority of the book is self-congratulatory anecdotes that aren't remotely relatable to those outside law enforcement.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  My boss made our group read this. A quarter way threw tossed it.  What a waste of trees.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Could all be said in 60% fewer words.  Not really anything new and nothing warranting the \"Atomic\" adjective.  I\\'m puzzled why so many on social media are praising such a poorly structured work., some form of compensation perhaps.  Don\\'t waste your money or time.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love this book! I got it just over a month ago and implemented some habit changes right away. 30 days later and I have 4 new habits locked in: a) drinking a sip of water every time I walk into the kitchen, b) eating 1 carrot before I open the snack cabinet, c) doing 10 pushups before I eat lunch, and d) walking after dinner to hit 5k steps for the day. He lays out the 4 components of every behavior: 1) the cue, 2) the craving, 3) the behavior, and 4) the reward, and then talks about how to influence them by making each one, respectively, 1) make the cue obvious, 2) make the craving attractive, 3) make the behavior easy 4) make the reward satisfying. And do the reverse to break and bad habit. He also talks about how to use the habit to change your identity, which has worked surprisingly well (I now feel more like the type of person who is healthy than just my 4 habits alone would suggest, which makes it easier to do them).And above all, when creating a new habit, focus most on cementing the habit as a new behavior, so make it incredibly easy to perform it and set the bar really low (I set my water/carrot/pushups goal such that it could be done in less than 15 seconds). Only later worry about the quality or quantity of doing it.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This book came to me as amazon recommended. I thought, oh great, another book on building good habits. But I took a glance at it, and decided to look deeper, so I bought a copy. It completely changed my thinking about setting and focusing on goals. I had fallen into the same trap the author writes about. I would set an ambitious goal, with no particular system for achieving that goal. I wasn't consistent about my goals. Sometimes I did the small 1% steps to get to the goal, other times I would do something a few times and give up. It was purely by chance whether I would stick to something or not. What I've learned from the book is to be systematic about my approach. Even more important to to align my identity to the goal I want to achieve.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I love how the book is clearly structured, making the principles easily applied to day to day life. However, the book is a little dry. The anecdotes were appealing but not entertaining enough.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  In short: I expected a lot - and I got it. :)Simple in content, not much new under the sun - but very clear and most of all actionable.Since I am a strong believer of the power of habits, this is a book I will keep rereading once in a while. Most refered books and authors were well known for me, but this does not take away the achievement of the author - who summarizes everything in a crisp and \"easy-to-put-into-practice\" way. This has NOT been done before by the other authors.I already made some changes, and reinforced some simple atomic habits, while reading te book.Congrats James, you have done well and created a very useful book for your followers.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I think I\\'ve read just about every book on habits ever written.  Some of them have been highly touted as the end all and be all of breaking bad habits and forming good ones.  I already use a habit tracker, but wasn\\'t moving the needle on my behavior and habits.  I frequent James Clear\\'s website and couldn\\'t figure out what he could have said in his book that he hadn\\'t already covered - or that someone else hadn\\'t covered.  I was wrong.After wearing me down with constant emails and offers (thanks, James) I finally said, \"Oh, what the heck - it may be a good read and I\\'ve spent money on way less important things.What Clear does is take the best of all the other studies on habits and synthesizes them down into a useful program for change.  Usually, I balk at too much information, but Clear presents it in such a manner as to make you go, \"Aha!\"I also like that he gives credit to those who came before like Charles Duhigg who wrote The Power of Habits.  Clear takes Duhigg\\'s work to the next level.So, thanks again, James, for bugging me until I finally got your book.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  For those who are at times weak-willed creatures of habit vs. logic (like me), this book is life-changing.  As a general rule you know something is spot-on when it had never occurred to you before, but after reading it, it just seems so obvious.  This book is focused mainly on 1) on setting up systems such as your environmental factors of how you make good or bad habits easier or harder for yourself [e.g. having potato chips in plain view on the counter, or putting your workout clothes out the night before] and 2) how to identify habits, set up goals and hold yourself to them.  I haven't achieved every single habit goal yet, but 6 months after finishing the book I've lost 30 pounds and re-instilled a handful of key good habits that I'd been wanting to get back to for years.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I enjoyed reading this book and it definitely brought together a lot of the ideas that exist around habits. I think it provides a great synopsis and will prove valuable if you actually want to implement good habits. The book gives every angle to habits including creating an identity to compare your habits against to making habits more attractive. If you attack your habits from every angle this book provides I imagine it will be much easier to create and sustain something. If you haven't already read a lot about habits I highly recommend this book. If you already have some knowledge about habits it may not be quite as valuable, but can definitely serve as a habit bible if you've had trouble executing on creating habits.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Listen, I am a family and lifestyle medicine physician who has been fascinated with improving lives by helping patients improve their lives which ultimately comes down to behavior change. I have devoured hundreds of books looking for a format to present to my patients about habit change and I finally found it! This book should be in the hands of every medical student and physician who cares about helping patients make better choices. Keep up the good work James, I am a super fan!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  James writes an excellent book here.  Magic baby steps that grow into mountains of personal gold.  The writing is quick, easy to read, with stunning insights that we can all use.  Some of the ideas are quite complex - human behavior, negative compulsion, changes.  This is heavy stuff - but he writes it so clearly and makes it so easy, it is like unlocking a giant dangerous lock with an easy key.  He also brings examples from 100s of sources.  You read this and you've read the best parts of another 100 books.  Key here is he gives you a magic key to make life better - NOW, and that little bit of better, the easy step, compounds into more and more benefit, this week, and next week, and in a month it is BIG and in 90 days it is HUGE.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I like many folks in life have been trying to change things up in my life. This desire for change has picked up greater urgency given the global pandemic. A lot of people are like myself looking at the pandemic and questioning the direction of their life. That’s the mindset in which I decided to read Atomic Habits. From the opening pages, it explodes the conventional mindset a lot of people myself included have that change has to be this big process.The relentless theme of atomic habits is that change is actually a more incremental process and that you are more likely to make the meaningful change if you change one little thing and then carefully add another and another until you don’t even think about doing these things. Eventually if you act with a goal in mind (whatever it is), you will discover that through a series of little changes built upon you are in a much better place regarding your goals and objectives.Atomic Habits really demystified change and reduced it from a thousand pound gorilla and made it more like a seventy-five pound German Shepard Mix. The big thing with change is the mental aspect and I think by following the premise of just doing a little bit, people will have much better results for the longer term. There’s really nothing that’s revolutionary or beyond intuition here, but sometimes the reminder helps.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Too long - same messages were repeated many times over (e.g. via whole chapters on corollaries).  Could have benefitted from numbered notes. I had assumed there were no notes until I was at the end of the book at which point I was no longer in the context where I\\'d want to read them.  So while I was reading it came across as devoid of scientific grounding. I have read more than one book on this topic and that probably contributed to my lack of engagement. One thing I found frustrating is that it repeats the overly-simplistic model espoused by Duhigg in \"The Power of Habit\": not everything fits the model of craving, reward, etc.  Addictions certainly do. But how about which shoe I tie first in the morning?  I was hoping this book would go beyond Duhigg.  Also while the issue of how hard it is to drive things based on long-term rewards was raised there were no ideas of what to do there. Even saying \"a bunch of failed research has yielded nothing\" would be better than raising the issue but then saying nothing conclusive. If this is your first book on the subject I suspect you\\'ll enjoy it.  But I don\\'t see how it *adds* much to the conversation.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  best sellers are the worst.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’d heard the name of James Clear for some time from industry peers and other authors. I have to confess, I thought he was another author jumping on the “how to build good habits” wagon. When Mr. Clear quoted a poem of mine some time back, I took a closer look. And I kept looking!  I was inspired and delighted by what I saw and read. He’s been constructing valuable and helpful content and fun needed into the world well before his book deal. His book is now  a reference book in my life library.Here’s what I observed that’s very different from typical non-fiction narrative in his book and his work in the world - transparency and authenticity. From the get-go James reveals the origin of his experience, his personal story, with habit building. That story alone is inspiring and motivating. What follows in ATOMIC HABITS is a synthesizing and integrating of his own experiences with all of the best information currently available about habit. Rather than try to impress you with prolific citations and academic language, Mr. Clear uses his narrative to impress upon you the manner in which positive, sustainable habits can be built in the reader’s life.This book has turned my head, disproven my initial assumption and inspired me to elevate my work in the world a percentage point at a time. If it’s not yet on the reference shelf of your life library, I encourage you to make sure that it is!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Of course to go way way back before it was written, I'd have to have invented time travel.  But who knows - if I really follow the wonderful directions in this book, I might.I've already roared through this book delighting in finding many great paths, suggestions, ideas, etc. that make so much sense.  Now I'll slowly go through it again, prioritizing the many habits I'd like to change to improve my life and I expect to be able to do many of them.  But my question remains - wouldn't it have been great to have had this with most of my life still ahead?So my advice is to buy it quick and get started.  It's appealing but best of all - doable.  Just think how much better you and your life will be when you start doing  XXX and stop doing YYYY.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  “What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers”*This is just the tip of the iceberg for this book. There is a reason James Clear’s advice is receiving over 40,000 five star ratings. I had to witness this for myself so as a bookworm that wishes to finally apply concepts from reading---I bought it.I think the reason this book was such a godsend for me, is that for the very first time, I have a book about habits that actually breaks down what habits are in “atomic” sized pieces, while not boring me at the same time. Secondly, the book has praises because the steps are actionable, which is important especially in this day and age where people’s good habits have went South and bad habits are increasing.I have utilized index cards and helpful templates from his website to jot down and journal my habits journey. This is key while reading his book. Please get this book only if you are serious about finally breaking free from bad habits. I enjoyed how he used real-life examples of athletes, regular people, authors, and philosophers to hone in on a good point.Already I am breaking the chains of bad habits and it is one day at a time. I wish the same for you all.*Quote is from Clear, James. Atomic Habits: an Easy Et Proven Way to Build Good Habits Et Break Bad Ones: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results. Avery, an Imprint of Penguin Random House, 2018, pg. 48\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking \"oh yeah, that\\'s similar to what I\\'m doing\". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.This quote from the last chapter summarizes the \"Four Laws of Behavior Change\" (that the book is about) well: \" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you\\'ll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won\\'t feel like starting and you\\'ll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you\\'ll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won\\'t feel like sticking with it and you\\'ll need to make it satisfying.\"Here\\'s some of the notes I made while reading the book:- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.- The \"Valley of Disappointment\" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It\\'s a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)- Make clear plans - Use the \"Implementation Intention\": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.- Use \"Habit Stacking\": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it\\'s good!)- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.- Use \"Temptation Bundling\" + \"Habit Stacking\": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a \"Gateway Habit\". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.- Prime your environment for future use - \"resetting your environment\" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you\\'ll be working from your bedroom)- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don\\'t let it derail you off your path)- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.Finally, some quotes I liked:- \"Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.\"- \"The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.\"- \"You have to fall in love with boredom.\"- \"Improvement is not just about learning habits, it\\'s also about fine-tuning them.\"- \"Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.\"And my favorite:- \"It is remarkable what you can build if you just don\\'t stop.\"\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This book has a few helpful tips and insights but gets redundant and obvious after the first few chapters.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I saw this book on the productivity section of Amazon books and I liked the cover page. I also saw the strong positive reviews and I decided to give it a read. I've wanted to get back into the habit of reading something or at least to create a ritual of reading books. I determined the best time to read was before I slept. Initially my goal was to read 1 word of a book each day (yes I know that sounds low) - actually got the idea from a podcast. But like the book points out it's a perfect way of getting the ball rolling. I'm glad that I purchased this book at the end of September 2021 and I am completing it after a full 30 days (300 pages) excellent book. My next book is Limitless by Jim Kwik.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  The first chapter seems to be bogus.  It talks of British Cycling and how Coach Brailsford brings British Cycling out of meteocrity to win the 2008 Olympics.  One rider won the Tour de France multiple times.  He had an excellent coaching plan of improving small things that ultimately would build up to one large thing.  In this case, better performance meaning a better time for the British riders.  Well....in early 2018 the British team was accused of blood doping and cheating.  In all fairness to the author, the book was printed before any of this was known.  It is a good read though and has many useful tips.  I just found that one story quite awkward!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This book is full of inspiration, motivation, and wise words! My mom had recommended it to me and I listened to the audio book first and then realized I needed to own an actual copy so that I could highlight favorite quotes, write my own notes, and have it to refer back to when needed. The author is fabulous and the book is one you won’t want to put down - in fact, as soon as you finish it, you’ll want to read it again! One of my favorite quotes -“Transformation is a slow process. If you study for an hour, you won’t learn the language. If you work out for 3 days, you won’t see visible weight loss. If you read the first chapter of a book, you aren’t going to know the whole story... Making a choice that is 1% better may seem insignificant at the time, but the impact OVER TIME is powerful. Success is the product of daily habits”.This is so important to remember! This book really lights a fire in me to commit to the process of changing my habits into making big life improvements!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I liked the main idea of the book about focusing on the main thing that needs to be done and letting the other things go. I also appreciated the discussion about the kinds of changes and kinds of habits that could be made (whether it is something you do or something you are).  So the first half of the book seemed really solid and explained a good approach to making incremental changes in your life.  After that, I found the book got distracted from the main theme.  There was discussion about the one thing in this aspect of your life and the one thing in another aspect of your life.  It seemed to me that this violated the overall thesis of the book.  I was somewhat disillusioned with the overall book as I got deeper into it.  But I recommend the book for its overall thesis and making the point about incremental change and focus,\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:1. \"Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You\\'d be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You\\'d be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?2. \"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon.  He achieved this goal!  And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don\\'t get set up sustainable systems.  Get the systems right and then we\\'ll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.3. \"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.\" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, \"hey, I\\'m an organized person.\" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You\\'re casting votes that may make you think \"well, I\\'m just a person that is always late.\" An un-virtuous cycle.  Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.4. \"How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in.\" Atomic Habits answers the question of \"how much time does it take to form a new habit\" with a better answer of : X number of actions.  Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.5. \"Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.\" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :)  (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: \"I\\'m on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)6. \"Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only \"watching TV\" when I\\'m on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I\\'m on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I\\'m running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :)  Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you\\'re already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.7. \"Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and \\'don\\'t break the chain.\\'\" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data.  My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.8. \"Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.\" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that\\'s okay for one day. Don\\'t let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don\\'t let it become three days...)9. Author James Clear gets to the point quickly in Atomic Habits and with actionable advice. James has been blogging about habits, health, happiness, creativity and productivity since 2012. Check out a sampling of his writing at his website. James is also fun to follow on Twitter. Atomic Habits has 20 relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries. If you listen to books on Audible, I highly recommend the audio book as James reads this book very passionately.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Another great read. I’m torn between 4.5-5 out of 5 stars. Clear has a great way of breaking concepts down to simple chunks (which is also mirrored in his short sentences) that mirror his idea of small (atomic) habits that build up to big results/larger concepts. At times however I was torn between wanting some of his concepts more condensed/succinct (perhaps it was too broken into pieces for me but it may be just right for other readers). I feel like I learned many of the concepts through other productivity and minimalist gurus (who may have read the book at the time) prior to reading the book but the explanation provided was excellent in its own right. The ideas toward the end about how genes may predisposed you to greater chances of success in certain habits than other people is an interesting lens on the topic. Additionally his concept of how boredom, and the ability to work through boredom, shapes mastery is an interesting thesis in the discussion of grit, specialization, and education. His work also deserves notice since it (and Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit) seems to have started a domino effect on writers/scientists discussing habits (the past 6-8 months I’ve heard promotions by BJ Fogg and other specialists promoting their books on importance of habits and habit formation on podcasts and the like).I’d also like to mumble about how disgruntled I am over the 9-9.3 inch length of hardcovers. The condensed feel of the Spanish paperback version that I bought (Hábitos Atómicos) is a much better user experience for me. And probably uses less resources for the same contentEdit: I forgot to mention in my above review about Clear\\'s tendency to use a single person he knows as an example. I found it an odd choice that here and there Clear uses examples of \"a man\" or \"a woman\" he knows/met because 1. Science is best supported with examples from multiple sources and 2. It makes his examples sound less common than they actually are. In one particular example that stuck with me, Clear talks about reframing and uses an example of \"a man\" he met who was asked how he felt about \"being confined to a wheelchair.\" Clear expressed surprise that the man replied that the wheelchair was enabling rather than restrictive. As someone with experience in healthcare, this was an interesting way to characterize the situation because it was as if Clear found this idea novel and unique (and writes as if everyone else would feel it to be novel) when in fact the assistive-device-as-an-enabling-tool is pervasive in the medical community. This doesn\\'t necessarily subtract or add stars to my overall review but it was certainly food for thought.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Good book! If you have been following James clears email list for the last few years like I have then you have already read 1/3 of the book. But other than that, the other information provided especially the habit formulas are very useful. I’m proud of James as a faithful follower for a few years. Yes this is not a scholarly article, it’s a typical “NY Times best seller”. But you can tell James is passionate about this topic, believes in what he says, wants to help people, and provides some useful strategies to do so. If you’re looking for ground breaking information you may be a little disappointed however, if you’re honest with yourself it not ground breaking information that you need. It’s applied practicality of the old wisdom that has been established that you need and James does this, and assembles this wisdom nicely in this book.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I'm in love with this book, therapy and psychiatry will only enable you to improve, they won't fix the problems for you. This book has helped me to work on myself like no other book has (the Bible doesn't count). Rereading it to remind myself of the things that made me optimistic about myself again and again. I recommend his Habit Journal as well, it's a HUGE value.There are three books I recommend to anyone trying to improve themselves, the Bible, Atomic Habits and 168 Hours. You'll want to buy extra copies to give away!I think I've said enough, suffice it to say, I recommend it.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  In chapter-2 of Charles Duhigg\\'s book \"The Power of Habit\", he introduces the Habit Loop. I feel that one chapter is worth the price of the whole book. (I guess I just reviewed Duhigg\\'s book) James Clear goes beyond where Duhigg leaves off: He writes the whole book around the Habit Loop. Then he gets into the Why of it all and the Why People Fail of it all.I\\'ve cleared Twyla Tharp off my shelf and added her to the bin of failed help-me books I\\'ve been too embarrassed to exhibit. Goodwill is going to fatten their larders on this basket of Hope. But it will do the bargain book buyers no good. Atomic Habits is not for resale.This is pretty much the end of the road for self-help publishing. If you can\\'t shock your monkey with this book, you don\\'t need analysis, you need remedial reading.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  So cliche to start off with, “I never take time write reviews..” - but I honestly never do.I have just finished this book and every single time I picked it up, my mind was blown. I have never thought so much about habits in the way that James laid it out - habits literally dictate our entire lives. I haven’t stopped making references in my various conversations to this book since I started reading. It has caused me to reflect so much on myself and my life, and I’m welcoming the changes.I intend to gift those I love with this book, this Christmas; it’s a must have for everyone who is looking to be a better them.Well written. Well researched. Easy to read.*Subscribe to his weekly newsletter as well. I’m a huge fan!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  but the book got crazy as you progressed.  for example, James Clear believes that you have to have a separate room for work, sleep, eating, etc.i wonder if this is because of his brain injury as a child.  it seems fine to me to use different rooms for multiple tasks.  often, i do my best thinking in the bedroom.  James believes that you should only sleep in your bedroom.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  In this book, Mr. Clear, guides us through a simple yet enlightening explanation of why our habits are hard to change. At the same time, he hands us a prize: A process to actually start changing and getting results!  It is upon us now to learn the lesson and apply the process and its laws to become the person we want to be.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Fantastic book. I've finished it and I'm grateful I purchased the physical book over the Kindle because this is a manual that I will go back and consult frequently. I can open it to any chapter and refresh my outlook and methods in some specific area of my life. I've been on a journey of constant and never-ending improvement for a while and Atomic Habits has given me golden nuggets for how to create systems rather than goals. Now I understand why some goals I set happen and some just don't, my desire for them was equal but my systems were not.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Boring!!!!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Driven to recover from a life altering accident that left the author, James Clear, in a medically induced coma; this book provides readers excellent advice on not only minimizing bad habits, but more importantly, building good habits that resulted directly from James\\' recovery. As the author set about achieving physical gains that were lost as a result of his injury, he developed an interest in why we do the things we do (i.e. how habits are gained and lost). This interest eventually manifested itself as a personal blog whose readership blossomed and eventually won him a book deal.Although Mr. Clear\\'s inspiring story is a good start to this book, his content is truly what makes this a great book which readers will undoubtedly continue to reference for years after their first reading. James is able to explain the process of habit formation and how to either increase or decrease habits in a very clear, understandable manner. This makes his narrative digestible as it describes how processes that are always with us but rarely scrutinized shape our lives. Couple this great narrative with a wide range of examples in areas as diverse as reducing time spent on social media and increasing time spent in the gym and it is easy to see what makes his very flexible approach to building \"atomic\" habits really connect with readers.While I think some of the author\\'s lines of inquiry like how does one think about a specific habit, how does one arrange their physical environment in a way that encourages or discourages a habit, and how does a habit fit into one\\'s own self view are terrific ways to help people implement his advice; I would have liked to see a greater quantity of examples. Despite featuring many varying types of examples, this book is a bit light on featuring examples that cross cultures or consider habit formation at different ages. Also, examples that did not directly involve the author\\'s experiences / behavior would have helped strengthen this book too.Despite this book being great for anyone, I specifically recommend it for people who are serious about self-improvement or making specific behavioral changes. Like many things in life, if the advice in this book is not used wholly or in part, then reading it really is a bit of a waste. While I would not go so far as to say this book is essentially a manual on building good habits, it is definitely written for a practitioner and not an academic or someone else who is just satisfied with admiring the problem of habit formation.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I’ve followed James Clear’s blog for some time now, and he has always been a very easy read. I love similar content to what he writes about, so he is essentially a “shortcut” to learning since he is a more voracious reader/learner than I.I enjoyed this book and think James did a wonderful job piggy-backing off his well-read background while retaining his own unique voice. This was not someone regurgitating what other people have written, but rather him taking all that he has learned and formulating it into a completed puzzle for our consumption.One thing that is tricky with books like this is that they are so easy to read that sometimes you forget they are only useful if you stop, think, and implement the suggestions into your day-to-day. Some books are more about insights and paradigm shifts, while I would say this book is one to study and be disciplined about applying to gain ultimate value from.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Wow, I was amazed.I was putting off reading this Book since Time Bought it. Today I've finally decided to start, along with my Personal notes.I was blown away with this Information and beautifully put together, Felt like this is the Book that can enlighten me if I implement it.Read from 1 to 26 Pages, in One sitting, couldn't stop but I've work tomorrow, so I will continue reading tomorrow.I recommend this Book.Thanks\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This book has changed my life. I am a carb addict and was becoming increasingly obese. In the past eight weeks, I have lost 17 pounds because this book help me address the mental challenges of addiction, which has led to behavioral changes, all in a painless way. I’m now committed to a healthy, sustainable eating plan, not a goal weight. I have daily chosen to be healthy and voted for the healthy person by making good food choices. This ongoing voting system has made it so easy to ignore the lure of the fast food drive-thru, the night-time munchies, and the  office goodies. For the first time in my life, I have the mental tools and the confidence that I will not only lose the weight, but sustain my weight in a healthy range because Mr Clear has taught me that change is about committing to a system, and not merely a goal. And, the confidence I have gained from my healthy eating system has helped me begin to make changes in unhealthy thought patterns that I realized were hampering my mental health, from depression to joy, just by choosing to commit to thought patterns that promote mental health. This book was a gift from God for me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to change their life for the better.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This was the best productivity book I have ever read because it was well written.  James Clear explains habits that make sense and are easy to understand.  Whereas other books contain a whole bunch of \"mumbo jumbo\" just to sell and have a lot of pages, or they include unrelated scientific research, I found The Atomic Habits book to be a great resource full of information that is current and practical.  It was simple to read and very helpful.  What made this book a 5 star is its simplicity, relatable examples, reflective analysis, and practical application.  I was able to start on a habit of losing weight after reading the book.  Other weight loss programs had superficial steps but this book went to the deeper core values of why and how to change bad habits.  It was so good, I ordered another book to give to a family member.  What\\'s more, is that whoever buys this book will be included in a mailing list.  So I continue to get short quotes and tips to maintain or improve habits.  I highly recommend this book to anyone for personal growth.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This book is very good. James Clear does a fabulous job of breaking down habit formation—or the giving up of “bad” habit—in a very concise and easy-to-follow way. It’s a book I like well enough I’ve purchased my own copy as I want the physical copy in front of me for future reference. I think reading Charles Duhigg’s “The Power of Habit” first was a good call on my part, as he explains in depth the science and psychology behind habits. Then James Clear picks up where that leaves off and gives us formulas for success in creating meaningful habits for ourselves. I’ve come away with some very good anecdotes for my own life, as well as things I’ve already begun teaching my students and children about habit formation.AUDIOBOOK REVIEW: Read by the author. The advantage of listening to a book read by its author is always that you’ll get the inflection and sound the author had in his head when he wrote it. A possible disadvantage is that he/she will be a full reader. That didn’t prove the case with Clear. I enjoyed this listen very much and found that he read the book at a speed probably typically faster than a lot of readers. I didn’t mind it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Reading this book has really changed my life.  You never know what\\'s going to click and finally help you do what you know to do.  Well, this book was it for me.  I have my daily to-do list, marking off everything from push-ups to bushing my teeth.  I could say on here just make a to-do list and start there.  Just do it and life will get better and easier.  What James does is help break down the science of the \"why\".  He helps to create a reason and desire to doing and maintaining a/the habit.  Having an understanding of the \"why\" helps to solidify the purpose and create a desire to make the habit real.  When you are reading through Atomic Habit, it helps you look at your past and see where and how your current habits were formed.  It helps give grace and space for the habits to grow.  It tells the \"why\" they take time and the \"how\" to be patient with yourself while you build new habits.  I\\'ve done 20 push-ups everyday since Dec 28th.  I\\'ve read for a minimum of 15 minutes everyday since Dec 28th.  I could keep listing the habits I\\'m building and the why, but the important thing is to read this book and find your habits and your why.The only real piece of advice I will say to look out for when reading this book is the main thing I think about when not looking at my list or looking at my list and and walking away without doing what\\'s on the list... \"I\\'m the type of person that...\".  Read the book and that will mean more and you\\'ll understand it better.  What I will end this with is, I\\'m the type of person that writes reviews for authors that ask after reading and enjoying their books.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Useful information overall. But book could have been a fifth of its size without lacking any important information. Author seems overly diligent in maximizing his return by links throughout the book to his website, email list and other sales.Also the author's claim about compounding results...1% each day for a year will give you 37 fold improvement in one year... is at best misleading and totally not applicable in this context.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  This book is fantastic, and it's modern GTD for those of us that want to change things.  I read the book and it was instantly accessible, understandable.WHAT TO EXPECT:A synthesis of other work with great stories to dial you in and make habits work.WHAT I DID:One of the things that has been tough is going to the gym.  I got out of shape (I used to be in way better shape).  I used a method of just going to the gym and working out for 5-10 minutes and going home.  That has created the gym habit in me again, and I'm now doing 45 minutes 5x a week.  Next week I'm adding weights back into my routine.It was jarring, at first, for sure.  Because going to the gym for 5 minutes feels pointless, but the whole point is to tick off part of your brain and make it desire the gym....There are other tricks habits and things that are part of this great book.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This book changed my life.  I had no idea how identity played into goals. Habits yes, but not identity.  The whole book is fantastic, but the most life changing portion of the book for me was when James Clear outlines the Three Layers of Behavior Change.1.  Outcome layer (the outer layer where we set our \"goals\".2. Process layer (the actual habits that support whatever goal we want to achieve.)3. Identity Layer (this is where you hold your beliefs and values about yourself and the world.)James teaches that most of us work from the outer layer inward, most of the time not even going beyond that outcome layer. But he argues that we need to change the direction and start in the innermost layer of identity and move to process.  Even just focusing on those two layers alone will naturally bring the desired outcomes in your life.I suddenly knew why I had not upheld certain habits in the past. I never changed my identity and the \"old identity\" sabotaged my success.Literally life changing for me. I\\'ve taken this information and transformed my life and work with incredible success. Thank you James for writing such a pivotal book.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  We all have habits good and bad.  If we can shift out of bad habits, and into more good and healthier habits. We would improve our bodies, minds, economics, our families, communities, and our country.  The processes in this book, give a practical methodology to changing your habits, and making more rational decisions that are based on the identity / person we want to become.  If was can understand the Laws of Good Habit Building (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, and Satisfying).  For breaking bad habits (Make it Obscure, Ugly, Difficult, and Painful), you can also combine the two to help motivate you in the right direction.  Wonderful, practical tactics for changing human behavior.  Second, it allows for greater understanding of the \"Effects of accumulation results of marginal gains\"  If you can improve 1% per week, in a year, you will have improved over 50% which means a fundamental change in who you are in most cases.  You have to set up systems to achieve your goals.  Prepare of unforeseen challenges that LIFE will throw at you.  Prepare three meals at one time, so you only have ONE major clean up instead of three.  Have mini meals ready so when you are hungry, you still stay on plan for your total caloric intake for the day.  It\\'s NOT the goals, but the systems you setup for yourself that determine your success.  When you are about to make a poor food choice, you can ask yourself, \"Would a health person eat this?\"  If the answer is no, than you are re-enforcing your identity and goals of a healthy person you wish to become.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I have listened to this book through Audible probably 30-40 times already, and I have given away this book as gifts to another 20+ people because of how useful I have found this book to be. Having gone through a handful of other \"success-oriented\" / \"self-improvement\" books, this is the PERFECT book (in my mind) for wrapping everything together and giving a step-by-step approach to ACTUALLY accomplishing your goals. I think the thing that I like MOST about this book is that it has so many super-practical examples about how to create, and sustain, the habits that YOU want to have. This is my go-to book when I\\'m having an off-day and it always brings me back to the basics of getting things done. I finally was able to conquer my previous tendency to leave messes everywhere; I made a new rule that, if I pick anything up at my house or office, I CANNOT set it down unless I am putting it where it belongs. For example, if I take off a jacket when I get to my house, I used to kinda set it down wherever I was (couch, stairs, etc...). Now I know to ask myself the simple question \"is this where this belongs? No, then you CAN\\'T set it down unless it goes where it needs to go\". It sounds simple (and it is!), but oddly enough my house & office and genuinely flipped over-night and I don\\'t have clutter anywhere! It\\'s insane! But that\\'s why I love this book. Thank you, James!!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I love books that help me view life (and therefore, my choices) differently from how we are taught to approach life; and a few have made lasting impact and helped me create the change I want to see in myself: Blake Mycoskie\\'s Do Something That Matters; Burnett and Evans\\' Designing Your Life; Keller and Papasan\\'s The One Thing. Now I get to add James Clear\\'s Atomic Habits for how it is actively and literally changing my life. Who knew there was a relationship between one\\'s habits and identity, and goals, and succeeding? OK, now that I\\'ve written that, I\\'m aware of how \"obvious\" that sounds, but how many of us actually stop the treadmill of life long enough to dwell on that \"obvious\" connection? If we did, there\\'d be a lot less of us walking through w regret, remorse, and low confidence from \"habit failures,\" as I like to call them.Then I pick up this book and Clear swimmingly, clearly explains the science-meets the lifestyle choices plus personal mental/ emotional choices involved in habit change. That it\\'s about designing our world (home, life, etc) in such a way that it\\'s easy to do what\\'s right. As he says, to \"redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.\"  I picked up this book amid seeking tools to reclaim positive habits I once had down but fell off. I couldn\\'t figure out why I was having so much trouble \"getting back into it\" so to speak, until I started read this awesome book. I will be reading and re-reading it for the next few years as I grow through current me into the habits of the identity of future me.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Wow.  This is one of the MOST unbelievable books I have read and has shed so much clarity for me.Mistake #1:  Self Discipline is over rated.Clarity #1:  Habits trump self disciplineMistake #2:  Success is about making big change(s)Clarity #2:  Sustainable successes is about making small invisible incremental change(s) that stickMistake #3:  I will change to make myself betterClarity #3:  Change your environment, friends, and the external changes will help you change your self for the better or worser depending on the environment and friends you choose.James has shattered So many misconceptions, we grew up learning from our parents, grandparents.  Things we learned but could never implement successfully.  James explains them WHY so clearly.When you want to improve your Business, children, family, or life.... READ Atomic Habits.William TehInvestor | Author | EntrepreneurTTTrends Investments\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is a good book, and anyone interested in self-improvement and personal change should read it.  You likely won't have your mind blown by the originality of the content, but Clear does a great job of reinforcing standard ideas and encouraging focus on systems of thinking that many of us (myself included) may have discounted or forgotten over time.The book itself won't change you, but it may inspire you to think different about your behaviors, better understand what motivates what you do, and take action to become a better version of yourself.The book is also a powerful launchpad for corporate or organizational conversation about these subjects.\\n\\n\"]\n"

I am absolutely baffled that this book is currently a bestseller with so many 5-star reviews. Are we just becoming dumber as a society? This book pulls points shamelessly from various well-known research and works by other authors, and Clear seems to think that mentioning and praising their work with an air of humility and admiration somehow justifies the fact that he is recycling, and not presenting anything new here. Then there are the quotes sourced from places like Reddit and Twitter (which will only be recognized by those of us who are more detail-oriented and who dig a little deeper)... which just makes it seem like we could all just go directly to Twitter or Reddit for our own inspiration.  I wanted to abandon this book before I was even a fourth of the way through it, but I stubbornly hung in there, wanting to remain open-minded and to give it a chance. Then sentences like \"Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm,\" and \"Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly\" began to jump out at me more and more. And don\\'t even let me get started on the charts and \"graphs\" that the author uses to support his painfully obvious points -- they are so insulting to the intelligence of any functioning adult of reasonable intellect that I found myself wanting to chuck this book with each subsequent \"illustration\" I encountered. (X and Y axis values, anyone?) If you are contemplating purchasing this book, and you are a reasonably intelligent adult -- don\\'t. Don\\'t waste your money, and more importantly, your precious time. Any grains of wisdom in this book, you can easily pick up from browsing through the preview. There is no additional wisdom, or useful strategies, to be found -- unless, perhaps, you have literally never read one single thing about the neuroscience behind habit formation. One decent Google search on strategies to form good habits and to break bad ones will readily get you more useful ideas than this entire 300 page book with its numerous references and links to Clear\\'s website.

I pulled out my phone and checked, and sure enough that team actually just started using illegal performance-enhancing drugs.  In all fairness, though, I guess that every other team cheats too, so that was probably the only way for them to actually stand a chance, and they may well have benefited from atomic habits on the road to victory.I wish they'd gone and published a revised version without the blatant BS right at the start, because that pretty much ruined the book for me.\",\n",
              " 'Decent but seriously overhyped, this book is a watered-down, distorted shadow of Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg.  If this book is from the Stone Age, then Tiny Habits is from the Space Age.  There are critically important, yet subtle points about the behavior change process that Clear misses in Atomic Habits but that Fogg emphasizes in Tiny Habits.  There\\'s coarse advice in Atomic Habits--such as habit contracts and accountability partners--that are probably more harmful than helpful in many situations.  Remember Fogg\\'s sage advice: \"I change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.\"  Tiny Habits is far more elegant, more concise, and presents a self-contained system that\\'s effective and universal and also explains anything in Clear\\'s book more neatly than Clear presents it himself.  If you have to choose between this book and Tiny Habits, I strongly recommend reading and using Tiny Habits instead.  Even if you\\'ve read this book, you should read Tiny Habits to pick up what you\\'ve missed out on here and to really calibrate your behavior-change system.  Atomic Habits smacks of being written by a motivational writer with a strong interest in habits who decided to cash in on his large email list with a book deal, while Tiny Habits is written by an actual behavior researcher and educator with a system proven to work on any level and who actually trained tens of thousands of people in his technique before deciding to write a book.  The only way in which Atomic Habits is superior to Tiny Habits is in its discussion of meta-habits (see the section on annual and semiannual reviews).  But even that stuff is freely available online in podcasts and blogs.  I couldn\\'t pick out a single original idea in this book.']"
