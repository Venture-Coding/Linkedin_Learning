## Computer Vision ##

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. - IBM  
  
Open CV is one of the most comprehensive Machine Learning libraries out there with more than 2500 optimized algorithms.  
While using OpneCV's dnn (Deep Learning) module, only **Inference** occurs. The model is already pre-trained and no more training takes place. Positively this saves a lot of computational time and power, as a normal CPU can also run it, GPUs not required.  
However the drawaback is ofc, you can't to fine-tuning on it.  
As of OpenCV 4.0, its dnn module supports Caffe, Tensorflow, Torch, Darknet, ONNX format models.  
No framework restrictions and not much external dependencies.  
16-bit FPO, faster than 32-bit FPO (floating-point-ops).  

Intel has also released the OpenVINO toolkit (Open Visual Inference and Neural network Optimization).   
(OpenVINO toolkit is a free toolkit facilitating the optimization of a deep learning model from a framework and deployment using an inference engine onto Intel hardware).
