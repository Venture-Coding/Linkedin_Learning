## Computer Vision ##

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. - IBM  
  
Open CV is one of the most comprehensive Machine Learning libraries out there with more than 2500 optimized algorithms.  
While using OpneCV's dnn (Deep Learning) module, only **Inference** occurs. The model is already pre-trained and no more training takes place. Positively this saves a lot of computational time and power, as a normal CPU can also run it, GPUs not required.  
However the drawaback is ofc, you can't to fine-tuning on it.
